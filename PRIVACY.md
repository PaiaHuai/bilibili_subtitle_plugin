# Privacy Policy for Bilibili Subtitle Plugin

Last updated: [Current Date]

This Privacy Policy describes how the Bilibili Subtitle Plugin ("Plugin", "we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our plugin within the Dify platform.

## Information We Handle

The Bilibili Subtitle Plugin requires access to your Bilibili account credentials to function. These credentials include:

*   **SESSDATA**: Your Bilibili session data cookie
*   **BILI_JCT**: Your Bilibili CSRF token
*   **BUVID3**: Your Bilibili browser unique visitor identifier

These credentials are provided by you and stored securely within your Dify environment's credential management system. The Plugin uses these credentials solely for the purpose of making authenticated requests to Bilibili's API on your behalf to:

*   Extract subtitles from Bilibili videos
*   Retrieve video information from Bilibili
*   Access video content that may require authentication

**We do not collect or store your Bilibili credentials or any other personal information within the Plugin itself.** The credentials are managed by the Dify platform as per your configuration.

## How We Use Information

The Plugin acts as an intermediary to interact with the Bilibili platform. The information retrieved from Bilibili (such as video subtitles, video metadata, or video details) is passed directly back to you through the Dify interface. We do not process or store this information beyond the immediate execution of your requests.

## Data Processing

*   **Video IDs**: You provide video IDs or URLs to extract subtitles from specific Bilibili videos
*   **Subtitle Content**: The plugin retrieves subtitle text and timing information from Bilibili
*   **Video Metadata**: Basic video information may be retrieved to ensure proper subtitle extraction

All data processing occurs in real-time and no data is permanently stored by the plugin.

## Third-Party Services

This Plugin interacts with Bilibili (bilibili.com). Your use of Bilibili is subject to Bilibili's own privacy policy and terms of service. We encourage you to review Bilibili's policies to understand how they handle your data.

## Data Security

While the Plugin itself does not store your personal data, we rely on the security measures implemented by the Dify platform to protect your credentials. Your Bilibili credentials are encrypted and stored securely within the Dify credential management system.

## Data Retention

The Plugin does not retain any data beyond the duration of each individual request. Once a subtitle extraction request is completed, no information is stored by the plugin.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

*   Remove your credentials from the Dify platform at any time
*   Stop using the plugin without any data retention concerns
*   Request information about how your credentials are being used

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
